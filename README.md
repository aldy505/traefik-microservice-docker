# Traefik + Microservice + Docker sample

Quick sample of a polyglot microservice that really just writes hello world.

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Then open these paths:
- localhost:8080/alyssa
- localhost:8080/pouring-alyssa
- localhost:8080/danica
- localhost:8080/customers/[add some value here]

For seeing the Traefik dashboard, open localhost:8081
